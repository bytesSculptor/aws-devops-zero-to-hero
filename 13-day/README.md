# Day-13 | AWS Code Pipeline | Jenkins vs AWS Code Pipeline | Open Source vs AWS Managed 


## AWS Code Pipeline vs. Jenkins


- [[Amazon Web Services | AWS]] Code Pipeline is a managed service offered by AWS for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), while Jenkins is an open-source CI platform.
