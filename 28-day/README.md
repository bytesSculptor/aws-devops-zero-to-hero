# Day-28 | Migrating applications to AWS cloud | Complete project details 


## Cloud Migration Process


- Cloud migration involves several stages: preparation, planning, migration, monitoring, and optimization.
- Preparation and planning are one-time activities where decisions are made about the migration approach.
- Migration is performed in multiple phases and involves tasks such as writing scripts, setting up monitors, and running test automation scripts.
- Monitoring is a one-time activity where the migrated applications are monitored to evaluate their performance and identify any issues.
- Optimization involves evaluating the benefits achieved by migrating to the cloud and identifying opportunities for further cost optimization or efficiency improvements.



## Cloud Migration Strategies


- The choice of migration strategy depends on factors such as application type, containerization, and security requirements.
- Common migration strategies include rehosting, replatforming, rearchitecting, retiring, retaining, repurchasing, and relocating.
- Rehost involves minimal effort by creating a similar environment on AWS, offering cost optimization but limited scalability and availability.
- Re-platform involves implementing AWS best practices and features for improved scalability, availability, and cost optimization.
- [[Code refactoring | Refactor]] involves re-architecting applications to be compatible with AWS and container services.
- Relocate involves moving on-premises platforms to cloud platforms like EKS or ROSA.
- Retain involves keeping certain applications on-premises due to security or importance.
- Retire involves discontinuing unused applications.
- Repurchase involves purchasing similar platforms on AWS or exploring other options.



## Database Migration


- Database migration requires finding the right fit on AWS and taking backups to ensure data integrity.
