# Day - 06 Route53

## Route 53
- Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service provided by AWS.
- It maps domain names to IP addresses, making it easier to remember and access applications.
- Route 53 simplifies DNS management for applications hosted on AWS by eliminating the need for users to purchase and manage their own DNS services.
- It intercepts user requests and resolves DNS names to IP addresses of load balancers.


## DNS

- DNS is crucial because it allows users to access applications using domain names instead of complex IP addresses.
- When using AWS services like EC2 or EKS, Route 53 provides DNS as a service to resolve domain names to IP addresses.


## Domain Registration and Hosted Zones

- Domain registration can be done through AWS or externally.
- Hosted zones are used to create DNS records, regardless of where the domain is purchased.


## Health Checks

- Health checks can be performed by Route 53 to monitor the health of web applications or servers.


## Further Learning

- AWS provides detailed documentation with practical examples for further learning about Route 53.
