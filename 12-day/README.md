# Day-12 | AWS CICD | AWS CodeCommit | What is CICD on AWS ? 


## AWS CodeCommit

- AWS CodeCommit is a managed [[Git]] repository service offered by [[Amazon Web Services]].
- It allows users to host and manage private Git repositories in the cloud.
- Advantages of AWS CodeCommit include being a managed service, scalability, security, and compliance.
- Disadvantages of AWS CodeCommit include potential cost and lack of some advanced features found in other Git repository services.



## Creating and Accessing an AWS CodeCommit Repository


- Creating a repository in AWS CodeCommit is similar to creating one on [[GitHub]].
- To access an [[Amazon Web Services | AWS]] CodeCommit repository using an [[Identity management | IAM]] user, you need to log in to the AWS console as the IAM user and copy the HTTPS clone URL of the repository.
- You can then clone the repository to your local machine using the [[Git | git]] clone command and provide your IAM user credentials when prompted.



## Comparison with Other Git Hosting Platforms


- AWS CodeCommit has fewer features compared to other Git hosting platforms like GitHub and [[GitLab]].
- It lacks advanced collaboration features, integrations with third-party tools, and a user-friendly interface.
- Due to these limitations, many organizations prefer using alternative version control systems like [[GitHub]], GitLab, or [[Bitbucket]].
