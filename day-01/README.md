# Day-1 | Introduction to AWS | What is Public Cloud ? | Create an AWS Account
## Introduction
- The speaker introduces himself and welcomes viewers to the first episode of the AWS Zero to Hero series.
- This series aims to provide foundational knowledge about public cloud and AWS.
- The speaker encourages viewers to watch the entire video before proceeding.
- This is a 30-day series where viewers will learn something new about AWS from a DevOps engineer's perspective.

## Agenda 
- Understand what cloud computing is.
- Compare public cloud and Private cloud.
- Explore the popularity of public cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- Discuss why AWS is popular among cloud platforms.
- Examine the recent trend of moving back from public cloud to on-premises.
- Create an AWS account for future learning.

## What is Cloud 
- Cloud computing is a concept where resources are provided as a service over the internet.
- In the past, organizations used to buy servers and create their own Data center.
- This was costly and inefficient as servers were often underutilized.
- Virtualization was introduced to solve this problem by creating virtual servers on top of physical servers.
- Cloud computing allows organizations to create virtual machines in any part of the world and share them with others.
- The concept of cloud computing is based on the idea that resources are interconnected and can be accessed from anywhere.
- Cloud computing is managed by system administrators and can be either private or public.
- AWS is a public cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services, including compute, storage, networking, and database services.
- AWS is a pay-as-you-go service, meaning that customers only pay for the resources they use.
- AWS is highly scalable, allowing customers to quickly and easily increase or decrease their resource usage as needed.
- AWS is reliable and secure, with a proven track record of uptime and security.
- AWS is used by millions of customers around the world, including large enterprises, startups, and government agencies.
- To create an AWS account, visit the AWS website and click on the "Create an AWS Account" button.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the account creation process.
- Once your account is created, you can log in to the AWS Management Console and start using AWS services.

## Private Cloud
- Private Cloud is exclusive to an organization.
- Private Cloud requires the organization to manage its own data center, employees, equipment, and temperature control systems.
- As an organization grows, maintaining its own servers becomes increasingly difficult and requires a separate, highly proficient team.
- Public Cloud is a service offered by companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
- Public Cloud providers manage the data centers and infrastructure, allowing anyone with an account to request resources.
- Public Cloud offers easy provisioning of virtual machines (instances) in various locations around the world.
- Users do not need to know the exact location of their virtual machines.
- Public Cloud is called "public" because anyone with an account can create instances, regardless of their organization.
- The difference between Public and Private cloud lies in who manages and maintains the Cloud platform.
- Public Cloud providers manage the entire ecosystem, while Private Cloud is managed by the organization itself.
- Security concerns in Public Cloud are addressed through the creation of virtual private clouds within the public cloud.


## Why Public Cloud 
- Public cloud is popular because it eliminates the need for companies to maintain their own data center.
- Maintaining a data center requires dedicated personnel and resources, which can be a significant overhead for startups and mid-scale companies.
- Public cloud platforms like AWS offer a simple onboarding process and a wide range of services, making it easy for organizations to get started.
- AWS initially started with a limited number of services, such as virtual machines, storage, and volumes.
- Today, AWS offers over 200 services, including popular services like Kubernetes.
- AWS continues to grow and expand its services based on market demand.

## Why AWS 
- AWS is popular because it has the first-mover advantage.
- AWS pioneered the cloud concept and many companies started their cloud journey with AWS.
- AWS has a large market share and many companies use AWS.
- Learning AWS increases chances of landing a job in cloud engineering.
- Cloud engineering concepts are similar across platforms, with slight differences in naming and user experience.
- For those starting their cloud journey, AWS is the recommended platform due to its large market share and job opportunities.

## Cloud Repatriation
- Cloud repatriation refers to moving from public cloud to private cloud.
- A small percentage (1-2%) of users are moving back to private cloud due to security concerns, lack of cost optimization, and not fully benefiting from public cloud.
- Startups and mid-scale companies often cannot afford data center in terms of money and maintenance, making public cloud a more viable option.

## Create AWS Account 
- To begin learning AWS, an AWS account is required.
- To create an AWS account, visit the AWS website and click on the "Create an AWS Account" button.
- Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the account creation process.
- Once your account is created, you can log in to the AWS Management Console and start using AWS services.
- AWS offers a free tier for users to explore its services without incurring direct charges.
