# AWS CLI Deep Dive

## AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)


- AWS CLI is a Python utility that allows users to automate AWS resource creation, management, and deletion through a command-line interface.
- AWS CLI simplifies the use of APIs by providing an abstraction layer that eliminates the need for complex code.
- AWS CLI acts as an intermediary between the user and AWS APIs, simplifying resource management.
- To install AWS CLI, follow the official AWS documentation and select the appropriate method based on your operating system.
- For Windows users, install Oracle VirtualBox and create a Linux virtual machine or install Git Bash for basic Linux commands and AWS CLI demonstrations.
- To authenticate AWS CLI, log in to your AWS account using the root user or IAM user.
- To verify installation, run [AWS](16f2bd17-15fb-4fef-86dd-7783f1f14f7f) --version in the terminal; a successful installation will display the version number.
- To configure AWS CLI, run AWS configure and provide the access key ID, secret access key, default region, and default output format.
- AWS CLI translates CLI commands into API calls that AWS understands.



## Using AWS CLI


- To list S3 buckets, run AWS S3 ls.
- To create an EC2 instance, use a command like AWS ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-id --instance-type t2.micro --key-name key-name --security-group-ids sg-id.
- To learn AWS CLI commands, refer to the AWS CLI Command Reference documentation.



## AWS CLI vs. Other Tools


- AWS CLI is useful for quick references and simple tasks like listing S3 buckets or creating EC2 instances.
- For more complex tasks, AWS CloudFormation templates or Terraform are better suited.
